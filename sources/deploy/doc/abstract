Abstract:
The main goal of this talk is to promote Big Data at the IAA.

A brief description of the Big Data problem is presented and how to solve it,
minimizing the technical details, reviewing previous work at IAA
and showing a practical case demonstration.

We have chosen Spark as the software tool that implements a solution to Big Data 
problem. Based on this tool, Cat-Spark application has been developed. It is an open
source project that can be used as template for our interaction with Big
Data to meet specific requirements. Cat-Spark contains a subset of Spark 
capabilities that includes common calculations and analysis: basic statical 
descriptive measures, data clustering no supervised, data spatial distribution and plot visualization.

We will give a basic guide for running Spark applications at IAA's computation cluster.

We will finish with a practical case: BOOM!, a project that uses Cat-Spark to 
analyse data of M-type stars, showing some "live" work  using the IAA cluster.
